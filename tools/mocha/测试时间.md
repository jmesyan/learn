TEST DURATION

Many reporters will display test duration, as well as flagging tests that are slow, as shown here with the “spec” reporter:

test duration

To tweak what’s considered “slow”, you can use the slow() method:

describe('something slow', function() {
  this.slow(10000);

  it('should take long enough for me to go make a sandwich', function() {
    // ...
  });
});
TIMEOUTS

SUITE-LEVEL

Suite-level timeouts may be applied to entire test “suites”, or disabled via this.timeout(0). This will be inherited by all nested suites and test-cases that do not override the value.

describe('a suite of tests', function() {
  this.timeout(500);

  it('should take less than 500ms', function(done){
    setTimeout(done, 300);
  });

  it('should take less than 500ms as well', function(done){
    setTimeout(done, 250);
  });
})
TEST-LEVEL

Test-specific timeouts may also be applied, or the use of this.timeout(0) to disable timeouts all together:

it('should take less than 500ms', function(done){
  this.timeout(500);
  setTimeout(done, 300);
});
HOOK-LEVEL

Hook-level timeouts may also be applied:

describe('a suite of tests', function() {
  beforeEach(function(done) {
    this.timeout(3000); // A very long environment setup.
    setTimeout(done, 2500);
  });
});
Again, use this.timeout(0) to disable the timeout for a hook.

In v3.0.0 or newer, a parameter passed to this.timeout() greater than the maximum delay value will cause the timeout to be disabled.
