# Structuring Your Specs
Ginkgo makes it easy to write expressive specs that describe the behavior of your code in an organized manner. You use Describe and Context containers to organize your It specs and you use BeforeEach and AfterEach to build up and tear down common set up amongst your tests.

Individual Specs: It
You can add a single spec by placing an It block within a Describe or Context container block:
````
var _ = Describe("Book", func() {
    It("can be loaded from JSON", func() {
        book := NewBookFromJSON(`{
            "title":"Les Miserables",
            "author":"Victor Hugo",
            "pages":1488
        }`)

        Expect(book.Title).To(Equal("Les Miserables"))
        Expect(book.Author).To(Equal("Victor Hugo"))
        Expect(book.Pages).To(Equal(1488))
    })
})
````
Its may also be placed at the top-level though this is uncommon.})

The Specify Alias

In order to ensure that your specs read naturally, the Specify, PSpecify, XSpecify, and FSpecify blocks are available as aliases to use in situations where the corresponding It alternatives do not seem to read as natural language. Specify blocks behave identically to It blocks and can be used wherever It blocks (and PIt, XIt, and FIt blocks) are used.

An example of a good substitution of Specify for It would be the following:
````
Describe("The foobar service", func() {
  Context("when calling Foo()", func() {
    Context("when no ID is provided", func() {
      Specify("an ErrNoID error is returned", func() {
      })
    })
  })
})
````
Extracting Common Setup: BeforeEach
You can remove duplication and share common setup across tests using BeforeEach blocks:
````
var _ = Describe("Book", func() {
    var book Book

    BeforeEach(func() {
        book = NewBookFromJSON(`{
            "title":"Les Miserables",
            "author":"Victor Hugo",
            "pages":1488
        }`)
    })

    It("can be loaded from JSON", func() {
        Expect(book.Title).To(Equal("Les Miserables"))
        Expect(book.Author).To(Equal("Victor Hugo"))
        Expect(book.Pages).To(Equal(1488))
    })

    It("can extract the author's last name", func() {
        Expect(book.AuthorLastName()).To(Equal("Hugo"))
    })
})
````
The BeforeEach is run before each spec thereby ensuring that each spec has a pristine copy of the state. Common state is shared using closure variables (var book Book in this case). You can also perform clean up in AfterEach blocks.

It is also common to place assertions within BeforeEach and AfterEach blocks. These assertions can, for example, assert that no errors occured while preparing the state for the spec.

Organizing Specs With Containers: Describe and Context
Ginkgo allows you to expressively organize the specs in your suite using Describe and Context containers:
````
var _ = Describe("Book", func() {
    var (
        book Book
        err error
    )

    BeforeEach(func() {
        book, err = NewBookFromJSON(`{
            "title":"Les Miserables",
            "author":"Victor Hugo",
            "pages":1488
        }`)
    })

    Describe("loading from JSON", func() {
        Context("when the JSON parses succesfully", func() {
            It("should populate the fields correctly", func() {
                Expect(book.Title).To(Equal("Les Miserables"))
                Expect(book.Author).To(Equal("Victor Hugo"))
                Expect(book.Pages).To(Equal(1488))
            })

            It("should not error", func() {
                Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
            })
        })

        Context("when the JSON fails to parse", func() {
            BeforeEach(func() {
                book, err = NewBookFromJSON(`{
                    "title":"Les Miserables",
                    "author":"Victor Hugo",
                    "pages":1488oops
                }`)
            })

            It("should return the zero-value for the book", func() {
                Expect(book).To(BeZero())
            })

            It("should error", func() {
                Expect(err).To(HaveOccurred())
            })
        })
    })

    Describe("Extracting the author's last name", func() {
        It("should correctly identify and return the last name", func() {
            Expect(book.AuthorLastName()).To(Equal("Hugo"))
        })
    })
})
````
You use Describe blocks to describe the individual behaviors of your code and Context blocks to excercise those behaviors under different circumstances. In this example we Describe loading a book from JSON and specify two Contexts: when the JSON parses succesfully and when the JSON fails to parse. Semantic differences aside, the two container types have identical behavior.

When nesting Describe/Context blocks the BeforeEach blocks for all the container nodes surrounding an It are run from outermost to innermost when the It is executed. The same is true for AfterEach block though they run from innermost to outermost. Note: the BeforeEach and AfterEach blocks run for each It block. This ensures a pristine state for each spec.

In general, the only code within a container block should be an It block or a BeforeEach/JustBeforeEach/AfterEach block, or closure variable declarations. It is generally a mistake to make an assertion in a container block.
It is also a mistake to initialize a closure variable in a container block. If one of your Its mutates that variable, subsequent Its will receive the mutated value. This is a case of test pollution and can be hard to track down. Always initialize your variables in BeforeEach blocks.
If you’d like to get information, at runtime about the current test, you can use CurrentGinkgoTestDescription() from within any It or BeforeEach/AfterEach/JustBeforeEach block. The CurrentGinkgoTestDescription returned by this call has a variety of information about the currently running test including the filename, line number, text in the It block, and text in the surrounding container blocks.

Separating Creation and Configuration: JustBeforeEach
The above example illustrates a common antipattern in BDD-style testing. Our top level BeforeEach creates a new book using valid JSON, but a lower level Context excercises the case where a book is created with invalid JSON. This causes us to recreate and override the original book. Thankfully, with Ginkgo’s JustBeforeEach blocks, this code duplication is unnecessary.

JustBeforeEach blocks are guaranteed to be run after all the BeforeEach blocks have run and just before the It block has run. We can use this fact to clean up the Book specs:
````
var _ = Describe("Book", func() {
    var (
        book Book
        err error
        json string
    )

    BeforeEach(func() {
        json = `{
            "title":"Les Miserables",
            "author":"Victor Hugo",
            "pages":1488
        }`
    })

    JustBeforeEach(func() {
        book, err = NewBookFromJSON(json)
    })

    Describe("loading from JSON", func() {
        Context("when the JSON parses succesfully", func() {
            It("should populate the fields correctly", func() {
                Expect(book.Title).To(Equal("Les Miserables"))
                Expect(book.Author).To(Equal("Victor Hugo"))
                Expect(book.Pages).To(Equal(1488))
            })

            It("should not error", func() {
                Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
            })
        })

        Context("when the JSON fails to parse", func() {
            BeforeEach(func() {
                json = `{
                    "title":"Les Miserables",
                    "author":"Victor Hugo",
                    "pages":1488oops
                }`
            })

            It("should return the zero-value for the book", func() {
                Expect(book).To(BeZero())
            })

            It("should error", func() {
                Expect(err).To(HaveOccurred())
            })
        })
    })

    Describe("Extracting the author's last name", func() {
        It("should correctly identify and return the last name", func() {
            Expect(book.AuthorLastName()).To(Equal("Hugo"))
        })
    })
})
````
Now the actual book creation only occurs once for every It, and the failing JSON context can simply assign invalid json to the json variable in a BeforeEach.

Abstractly, JustBeforeEach allows you to decouple creation from configuration. Creation occurs in the JustBeforeEach using configuration specified and modified by a chain of BeforeEachs.

You can have multiple JustBeforeEaches at different levels of nesting. Ginkgo will first run all the BeforeEaches from the outside in, then it will run the JustBeforeEaches from the outside in. While powerful, this can lead to confusing test suites – so use nested JustBeforeEaches judiciously.

Some parting words: JustBeforeEach is a powerful tool that can be easily abused. Use it well.
Global Setup and Teardown: BeforeSuite and AfterSuite
Sometimes you want to run some set up code once before the entire test suite and some clean up code once after the entire test suite. For example, perhaps you need to spin up and tear down an external database.

Ginkgo provides BeforeSuite and AfterSuite to accomplish this. You typically define these at the top-level in the bootstrap file. For example, say you need to set up an external database:
````
package books_test

import (
    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"

    "your/db"

    "testing"
)

var dbRunner *db.Runner
var dbClient *db.Client

func TestBooks(t *testing.T) {
    RegisterFailHandler(Fail)

    RunSpecs(t, "Books Suite")
}

var _ = BeforeSuite(func() {
    dbRunner = db.NewRunner()
    err := dbRunner.Start()
    Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())

    dbClient = db.NewClient()
    err = dbClient.Connect(dbRunner.Address())
    Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
})

var _ = AfterSuite(func() {
    dbClient.Cleanup()
    dbRunner.Stop()
})
````
The BeforeSuite function is run before any specs are run. If a failure occurs in the BeforeSuite then none of the specs are run and the test suite ends.

The AfterSuite function is run after all the specs have run, regardless of whether any tests have failed. Since the AfterSuite typically includes code to clean up persistent state ginkgo will also run AfterSuite when you send the running test suite an interrupt signal (^C). To abort the AfterSuite send another interrupt signal.

Both BeforeSuite and AfterSuite can be run asynchronously by passing a function that takes a Done parameter.

You are only allowed to define BeforeSuite and AfterSuite once in a test suite (you shouldn’t need more than one!)

Finally, when running in parallel, each parallel process will run BeforeSuite and AfterSuite functions. Look here for more on running tests in parallel.

Documenting Complex Its: By
As a rule, you should try to keep your Its, BeforeEaches, etc. short and to the point. Sometimes this is not possible, particularly when testing complex workflows in integration-style tests. In these cases your test blocks begin to hide a narrative that is hard to glean by looking at code alone. Ginkgo provides by to help in these situations. Here’s a hokey example:
````
var _ = Describe("Browsing the library", func() {
    BeforeEach(func() {
        By("Fetching a token and logging in")

        authToken, err := authClient.GetToken("gopher", "literati")
        Exepect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())

        err := libraryClient.Login(authToken)
        Exepect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
    })

    It("should be a pleasant experience", func() {
        By("Entering an aisle")

        aisle, err := libraryClient.EnterAisle()
        Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())

        By("Browsing for books")

        books, err := aisle.GetBooks()
        Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
        Expect(books).To(HaveLen(7))

        By("Finding a particular book")

        book, err := books.FindByTitle("Les Miserables")
        Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
        Expect(book.Title).To(Equal("Les Miserables"))

        By("Check the book out")

        err := libraryClient.CheckOut(book)
        Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
        books, err := aisle.GetBooks()
        Expect(books).To(HaveLen(6))
        Expect(books).NotTo(ContainElement(book))
    })
})
````
The string passed to By is emitted via the GinkgoWriter. If a test succeeds you won’t see any output beyond Ginkgo’s green dot. If a test fails, however, you will see each step printed out up to the step immediately preceding the failure. Running with ginkgo -v always emits all steps.

By takes an optional function of type func(). When passed such a function By will immediately call the function. This allows you to organize your Its into groups of steps but is purely optional. In practice the fact that each By function is a separate callback limits the usefulness of this approach.
