# 介绍

Ginkgo is a BDD-style Golang testing framework built to help you efficiently write expressive and comprehensive tests. It is best paired with the Gomega matcher library but is designed to be matcher-agnostic.

These docs are written assuming you’ll be using Gomega with Ginkgo. They also assume you know your way around Go and have a good mental model for how Go organizes packages under $GOPATH.


#获取安装
Just go get it:
````
$ go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
$ go get github.com/onsi/gomega
````
this fetches ginkgo and installs the ginkgo executable under $GOPATH/bin – you’ll want that on your $PATH.

Ginkgo is compatible with Golang v1.4+ Ubuntu users: apt-get currently installs v1.0 – you’ll need to upgrade!

## 遇到的墙 gopkg.in/yaml.v2 无法下载

- path -git clone https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml.git 
- 在src 目录下 创建 gopkg.in 目录  把yaml 重命名为yaml.v2 ,然后在执行  go install
